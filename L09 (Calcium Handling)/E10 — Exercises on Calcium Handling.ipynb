    "\n",
    "We start by implementing a simple calcium cycling model to explore intracellular calcium handling a bit more hands on. The model you implement is based on a work by Friel et al. (1995). The original model was made to explain experimental findings of caffine-induced calcium oscillations in sympatheic neurons. We use the model as propsed by Friel, but change a few of the variable names to be more consistent with how we present the material in L10/E10."

    "* The extracellular space, outside the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the concentration of calcium in each of these domains as $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_{\\rm i}$, $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_{\\rm SR}$ and $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_{\\rm o}$ respectively. The first two of these are model states which change over time, while we assume the extracellular concentration to be constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four fluxes between these domains:\n",
    "* There is an external calcium entry through the sarcolemma: $J_{\\rm entry}$\n",
    "* There is an extrusion of calcium through the sarcolemma: $J_{\\rm extrusion}$\n",
